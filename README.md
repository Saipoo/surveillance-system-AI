# GuardianEye

GuardianEye is an AI-powered surveillance and student management system designed for educational institutions. It leverages computer vision and AI to automate uniform detection, emergency and movement tracking, attendance, and mask detection, providing a secure and efficient environment.

## Features

- **Uniform Detection System:** Detects if a student is wearing the registered uniform and provides permission status using AI.
- **Emergency Detection System:** Identifies emergency gestures or visible health issues and suggests treatment plans using AI.
- **Movement Tracking:** Tracks student presence duration in camera view and logs movement data.
- **Facial Recognition-Based Attendance:** Automatically marks attendance with face recognition, linked to student details and subject selection.
- **Face Mask Detection:** Detects if a person is wearing a mask.
- **AI Chatbot:** Provides contextual help and assistance via a sidebar or floating button.
- **Logs Export:** Export attendance and movement logs to Excel for record-keeping.

## Objectives

- Enhance campus safety and security using AI-driven surveillance.
- Automate routine monitoring tasks to reduce manual effort.
- Provide real-time alerts and actionable insights for emergencies.
- Maintain accurate attendance and movement records.
- Ensure compliance with uniform and mask policies.
